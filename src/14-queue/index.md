# Queue

Is it a Data Structure or algorithm?

Well... now we get into philosophy. Is what we are going to see next an algorithm on a linked list or is it a data structure on its own?

## Queue propiamente dicho

The queue is a data structure that allows us to store elements in a certain order. The order is FIFO (First In First Out). This means that the first element that enters the queue is the first element that leaves the queue.
